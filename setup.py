**Notes:**
    In order for the Custom Install wrapper to run successfully we have to use the source distribution
    when we are building our archives. This is done by running the command:
        python setup.py sdist

    This creates a *.tar.gz source file that we use to send to PyPi/TestPyPi that will run setup.py
    compared to shipping a wheel, *.whl, which is binary and does not run any post-install logic.
